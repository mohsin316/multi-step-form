## My process

I built this with the help of react, formik and framer motion. Im glad it turned out the way it did. Only issue is when the user does not select a plan and decides to go to the previous component, they will not be able to go forward as clicking the next button submits the form and formik will not allow this as they have not selected a plan which is a required field. If anyone can find a better solution to that do let me know!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Formik library
- Framer motion
